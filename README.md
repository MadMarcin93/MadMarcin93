👋 Hi, I’m @MadMarcin93

👀 I’m interested in programming.
🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building websites.
📫 How to reach me: (Still need to create a LinkedIn account or something like that.)
⚡ Fun fact: I was a chef for the last 8 years, so I know how to cook something. Mise en place is important in both the kitchen and programming!
