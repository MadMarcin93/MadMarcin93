👋 Hi, I’m @MadMarcin93

👀 I’m interested in programming and curious about the world.
🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building websites.
📫 How to reach me: (Still need to create a LinkedIn account or something like that.)
😄 Pronouns: (You can add them here if you’d like.)
⚡ Fun fact: I was a chef for the last 8 years, so I know how to cook something. Mise en place is important in both the kitchen and programming!
